in this world full of yellow
i wanna be your blue,
just like how roses are red
my feelings for you isn't fleeting or overdue

writing this poem is not me creating a drama
nor making you ...

Im sure you think u did nothing,
but you do inspire me, 
to change
to be better
I stopped my bad habits

Someday, i dream of winning
not only your swift replies
nor your updates and assurances
I wanna win the truth behind your sadness, 
I wanna be the reason of your smiles
the softness of your touch
and the warmth of your hugs

I do get it, i may not be your type
thats alright, my resolve isn't that weak 
nor easy to break
call me mr lover man
cause even when im shattering, or spilling out
upon this linoleum ground
im reeling in my brain again

Someday in our time, I dream of winning the chance
making you feel loved, cared 



so may I?
May I have the chance to prove myself by courting you?
