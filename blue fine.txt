In this world so full of yellow,
I want to be your shade of blue.
Just like how roses bloom in red,
My feelings are sincere, patient, and true.

This must be the feeling—just admiring from afar,
When a glance from you feels brighter than any star.
I watch, I wonder, but I never intrude,
Content in silence, with thoughts of you subdued.

This poem’s not a crafted drama,
Nor a plea to win your gaze.
I just need you to know,
You've lit a spark that set me ablaze.

You may think you've done nothing,
But you've inspired me to change—
To grow, to rise, to better myself,
To let go of habits I couldn't estrange.

Someday, I dream of winning—
Not just your swift replies,
Or fleeting updates and soft assurances,
But the truth behind your silent cries.

I want to be the reason you smile,
The calm in your restless night.
The softness behind your every touch,
The warmth that holds you tight.

I get it—I might not be your type.
That’s fine; I’m not so weak or breakable.
Call me Mr. Lover Man—
Even shattered, I'm unshakable.

Spilling thoughts on linoleum floors,
Still reeling in my crowded mind—
But in some future stitched by time,
I dream of being the love you find.

So may I…
May I have the chance to prove it true—
To capture your heart, and cherish you?
So may I? May I court you?
